## Contributing


Thanks for taking an insterest in contributing to the PowerShell package for
Sublime Text 3!


### Development

Development happens on the **dev** branch. Please send your PRs against that
branch only.


#### Running Tests

If you ara adding functionality or making substantial changes to existing
code, please add tests and ensure that existing tests pass.

Currently, we have very few tests and they aren't easy to run... :-(

If you feel lazy about writing tests, this is the right time to contribute --
we'll turn a blind eye more often now than later on! ;-)


### Building Versions

The easiest way to 'build' a version now consists in copying the top-folder's
content to your *Data/Packages/PowerShell* directory.

We have build scripts under *.\bin*, but they aren't realiable. We hope to fix 
this soon.
